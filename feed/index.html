					<description><![CDATA[So what is a day in my life like these days? I still haven&#8217;t started going to work, I am still &#8220;quarantined&#8221; at home. I have lost the count of the number of the days under lock-down. Nothing really changes when you spend everyday at home doing almost nothing. But I try to not stay [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Last year, around this time, I was preparing for my board exams. After the exams were over, my 9â€“5 commitment continued. I was constantly trying to catch up with my life.

She loved the the rhythm of the falling rain and the fresh smell of mud when it rained. She loved the rain and the rain loved her back. She danced [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Time and again, she goes through these lurid chord of emotions. She holds the biggest hurt, and yet she perfectly conceals it with her smile. She unceasingly acts to be strong, even when it is tiring her. She wonders in isolation, &#8220;Will it get any better?&#8221;. A dream that was so close to her heart, [&#8230;]]]></description>
